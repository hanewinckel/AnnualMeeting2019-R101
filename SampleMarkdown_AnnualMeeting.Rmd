```{r Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin, echo=FALSE}
packages <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "doParallel", "foreach", "glmnet", "survival", "splines", "xgboost", "dplyr", "rprojroot")
if (length(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))>0){
     install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
}
update.packages(packages)
```
